# 22-23 Winter Hackathon

- `bouncing-balls`: Bouncing balls web simulation with self-implemented physics
- `Compound interest`: Compount Interest Calculator
- `poker`: Texas hold'em poker game (currently single-player only)

## Bouncing balls
25 balls of random size, color, velocity are created. Use `AWSD` to move the Evilball (transparent with white border) and eat the other balls. A total ball count is kept on the upper right corner of the page. 

P.S. When two balls collide, they bounce off each other and both change to another random color. 

## Compound interest calculator
Calculator with 4 input fields: primary amount, interest rate, time cycle, final amount. Given any 3 of the 4 fields, the calculator can compute the remaining field. More detailed instructions are given on the webpage.
